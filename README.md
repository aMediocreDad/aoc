# Advent of Code
![aoc](./aoc.webp)
This is a newly made repository for my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. The intention is to complete the challenges in Rust, and to use this as a way to improve with the language.

## 2023
To run the code for a given day, use the following command:
```bash
cargo run --bin d<day>_p<part>
```

Tests can be run with:
```bash
cargo test
```
